## Project Overview
The project INDRA, developed in collaboration with Alt Surya Inc. and Columbia University's QMSS Program, aims to build a machine learning-based system for predicting cloudbursts in urban areas within a 6-hour window. It involves analyzing NOAA and FEMA datasets, applying time series forecasting techniques, and integrating GIS mapping to identify high-risk areas. The goal is to surpass the current 50% prediction accuracy benchmark, enhance disaster preparedness, and support smart city infrastructure with real-time climate risk insights.

## Role & Responsibilities
Contributing to data processing, predictive modeling, and model evaluation, integrating statistical methods, time series analysis, and visualization to enhance cloudburst prediction and disaster preparedness. Working cross-functionally to integrate insights into user-friendly solutions.
