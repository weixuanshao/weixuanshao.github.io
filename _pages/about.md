## Research Interests
I am interested in applying quantitative methods to social sciences, focusing on:
- Socio-economic factors and their influence on behavior
- Psychology & decision-making in social and economic contexts
- Sociology & cultural dynamics shaping human interactions

## QMSS Practicum Project
As part of Columbia University's QMSS Practicum in Data Analysis, I am working with Alt Surya Inc. to develop INDRA, a machine learning-based system for predicting cloudbursts in urban areas within a 6-hour window. The project will involve analyzing NOAA and FEMA datasets, applying time series forecasting techniques, and integrating GIS mapping to assess risk areas. Our goal is to improve prediction accuracy beyond the current 50% benchmark, enhance disaster preparedness, and support smart city infrastructure with real-time climate risk insights.
